# A Deep Learning Approach to Solve Cubic Equations using PyTorch

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be used to solve cubic equations
of the form:

ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0

Instead of using traditional mathematical formulas, a neural network is trained
using PyTorch to directly learn the value of x that minimizes the equation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Google Colab

## Key Concepts
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- ReLU Activation Function
- Mean Squared Error Loss

## Files
- cubic_equation_solver_pytorch.ipynb: Colab notebook with full implementation
- cognitiveclass_100_percent.png: Course completion proof

This project was completed as part of a deep learning learning task.
